        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients in separate bowls</li>
                <li>Combine tomatoes, chicken broth, garlic cloves,
                     and a large slice of onion in a stockpot over 
                     medium heat. Bring to a boil, and gently simmer 
                     for about 20 minutes to blend flavors.
                </li>
                <li>Remove from heat and run the mixture through a food
                     mill into a large bowl, or pan. Discard any stuff 
                     left over in the food mill.
                </li>
                <li>Melt butter over medium heat in the now empty stockpot.
                     Stir in flour to make a roux by cooking, whisking constantly,
                      until mixture turns medium brown.
                </li>
                <li>Gradually whisk in a bit of the tomato mixture to prevent lumps
                     from forming, then stir in the rest.
                </li>
                <li>Season with sugar and salt to taste.</li>
                <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
